# cafeherrera-static

This is a static HTML version of a prototype website I built for a Dallas restaurant, named Cafe Herrera. We never actually launched this version, and you'll see much of the content is just temp filler. The design for the site was by Switch in Dallas. I developed the website, including all the layout and interactivity.

This website is for my portfolio only.
